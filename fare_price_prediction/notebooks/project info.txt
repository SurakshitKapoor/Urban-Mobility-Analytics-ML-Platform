Yes — **fare prediction** and **passenger-type prediction** are *real, practical problems* used in apps like ride-hailing platforms.

They help with:

* **Dynamic pricing** (predicting fare based on distance, demand, etc.)
* **Customer segmentation** (predicting new vs repeat passenger)
* **Personalized offers**
* **Demand forecasting**
* **Driver allocation**

So yes — your projects reflect **actual real-world use cases** in Uber/Ola-type systems.

also, especially for fare prediction:
Fare prediction solves **multiple real business problems**, such as:

* **Dynamic pricing** → adjust fares based on demand, distance, time.
* **Transparent pricing** → show users an accurate upfront fare.
* **Fraud detection** → detect abnormally high or low fare patterns.
* **Route optimization** → recommend cheaper or faster routes.
* **Driver earnings forecasting** → estimate income per trip.
* **User trust & conversion** → accurate fare estimates increase ride bookings.

So it’s not just prediction — it supports **pricing strategy, operations, and user experience**.



If you build a high-quality fare prediction model, it becomes useful because the business can plug it directly into real products:

So what is your value as a data scientist?

You build the algorithm that powers pricing—one of the most important systems in mobility companies (Uber, Ola, Lyft).

TL;DR

A good fare prediction model becomes:
a product feature + a pricing engine + a fraud detector + a forecasting tool.

That’s why it’s extremely useful.

and, Building the fare prediction model in a notebook is exactly what your team expects from you, but turning it into a real product usually involves ML engineers, data engineers, platform teams, etc.
